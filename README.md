# Python OOPs: Assignment-4 

## Overview

#### This repository is dedicated to exploring **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in **Python**, focusing on key principles like **Polymorphism** and **Encapsulation**. The assignments and examples are designed to provide a solid foundation in OOP while also showcasing advanced techniques such as method resolution order (MRO), magic methods, and decorators.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Core OOP Concepts**
   - **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem domain.
   - **Encapsulation**: Restricting direct access to object attributes while providing controlled interfaces.
   - **Polymorphism**: Writing generic code that can work with objects of different types.
   - **Inheritance**: Reusing and extending existing code via hierarchical relationships.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
   - Implement private attributes in Python using name mangling.
   - Provide controlled access using getter and setter methods.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
   - Use method overriding to define specific behaviors in subclasses.
   - Leverage Python's dynamic typing for polymorphic behavior across unrelated objects.

### 4. **Inheritance**
   - Explore Python’s five types of inheritance:
     - Single
     - Multilevel
     - Multiple
     - Hierarchical
     - Hybrid
   - Address the **Diamond Problem** using Python’s Method Resolution Order (MRO).

### 5. **Magic Methods and Advanced Techniques**
   - Override magic methods like `__str__`, `__add__`, and `__repr__` for custom behavior.
   - Implement abstract base classes using the `abc` module.
   - Use decorators for functionality like execution time measurement.

### 6. **Practical Applications**
   - Build reusable, maintainable, and scalable Python applications using OOP.
   - Implement static and class methods for utility and instance management.

## Assignment Highlights

## The repository contains 15 hands-on questions designed to improve your Python OOP skills. Here’s a summary:

- **Abstract Classes and Polymorphism**:
  - Create an abstract base class `Shape` and implement subclasses like `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
  - Write a function that calculates areas of different shapes using polymorphism.

- **Encapsulation**:
  - Develop a `BankAccount` class with private attributes for `balance` and `account_number`. Implement methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

- **Static and Class Methods**:
  - Write static methods for utility functions, such as checking if a year is a leap year.
  - Track the number of instances created using class methods.

- **Decorators**:
  - Create a decorator that measures and logs function execution time.

- **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**:
  - Understand and demonstrate Python’s MRO with practical examples.

- **Magic Methods**:
  - Implement `__str__` and `__add__` magic methods to enhance class functionality.
