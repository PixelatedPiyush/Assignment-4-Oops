    "#### Python does not directly support method overloading in the same way as languages like Java or C++. Instead, Python provides a more flexible approach where multiple methods with the same name are not allowed within the same class. However, method overloading in Python can be achieved by default arguments, variable-length arguments, or using a decorator like @overload (from the typing module, but only for type hinting purposes).\n",
    "#### How Python Simulates Method Overloading:\n",
    "#### Default Arguments: You can define a method with default values for some parameters. This allows the method to behave differently based on the number of arguments passed.\n",

    "#### Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python\n",
    "#### The Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python searches for a method or attribute in a class hierarchy. It is particularly important in the case of multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from more than one parent class. The MRO determines the order in which base classes are checked when trying to access a method or attribute of an object.\n",

    "#### The MRO is governed by the C3 Linearization algorithm, which ensures a consistent and unambiguous order for method lookup. This order is based on the inheritance hierarchy, with classes being searched from left to right, and follows certain rules to maintain the integrity of the inheritance structure.\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "#### In single inheritance, the MRO is simply the class itself and its parent class, in that order.\n",
    "#### In multiple inheritance, Python resolves the method lookup by searching through the classes in the order defined by the MRO.\n",
    "#### The MRO ensures that the method resolution respects both the inheritance order and the method's position in the inheritance chain."
